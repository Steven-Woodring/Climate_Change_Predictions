# Project Untitled
This team project aims to use past CO2 emissions data up until 2018 to predict future (2019 and 2020) emissions - then uses a machine learning model to test our hypothesis. The team is comprised of Brandon, Kat, Steven, and Camille. We believe that our prediction will be accurate in 2019 and inaccurate in 2020, since 2020 was a novel year. 

### Background ###

We selected this topic because we wanted to work on a salient issue - and we also wanted to measure the accuracy of our machine learning model against actual data. Since there is so much research on emissions and environmental impact, this topic aligned with our goals. 

Our team selected world emissions data from CAIT via Kaggle. CAIT is an open source website dedicated to monitoring greenhouse gas emissions by country. They compile data from a variety of national and international sources on their website. 

### Hypothesis ###
We have several questions we expect that this data will answer. The main questions for our project are:
* Can our machine learning model accurately predict 2019 emissions data?
* Will our machine learning model inaccurately predict 2020 data, since the onset of coronavirus and subsequent quarantine orders greatly reduced emissions?



### Team Communication Protocols ###
We've decided to work asynchronously as much as possible, providing updates to each other in a group Slack. We meet on Mondays and Wednesdays via Zoom, where we think through any challenges we're facing and create a plan to address them. We each have our own branch in this repo where we push updates and may create separate repositories on our own accounts to create first drafts of code.
